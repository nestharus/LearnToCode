This is the best I could do. There isn't any code in the java classes for all browsers except the Function Browser (where all browsers are actually implemented up to this point). I've also added a bit to the menu bar. Additionally, I pasted a Toolbar Demo class off of Oracle, but it's only a template. You know where to find it. ;-)
